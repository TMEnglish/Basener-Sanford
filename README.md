# Basener-Sanford

Replication and critique of the numerical experiments reported in Section 5 of Basener, W.F. & Sanford, J.C. [The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-017-1190-x), J. Math. Biol. (2017).

This repository is a binder of Jupyter notebooks. If you want simply to view the notebooks, click on the `.ipynb` links above. (Note that GitHub sporadically fails to display notebooks.) If you want to work with the binder on a JupyterHub server, then click on the icon below, and wait patiently for the configuration of a virtual machine to complete.

Thanks to [MyBinder.org](MyBinder.org) for providing this excellent service free of charge. Don't blame their server for the slow launch of the binder, which contains a large volume of data.

Thanks also to William Basener for granting me permission to reuse the code for [Realistic Mutation-Selection Modeling](https://people.rit.edu/wfbsma/evolutionary%20dynamics/EvolutionaryModel.html), some of which is included in `BS.js`. Basener retains copyrights, and has not issued a public license.
