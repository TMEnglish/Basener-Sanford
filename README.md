Replication and critique of the numerical experiments reported in Section 5 of Basener, W.F. & Sanford, J.C. [The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-017-1190-x), J. Math. Biol. (2017).

This repository is a binder of Jupyter notebooks. If you want simply to view the notebooks, click on the `.ipynb` links above. (GitHub sporadically fails to load notebooks, so don't give up if you encounter an error.) If you want to work interactively with the notebooks on a JupyterHub server, then click on the icon below, and wait patiently for the configuration of a virtual machine to complete.
